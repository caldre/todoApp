<b>Todo app using React with hooks</b>

While it was nice practice for me building this app, it was also inteded as a pre-task for applying to job as a web developer. I tried to make effort on slick looking UI, also had fun experience implementing dark mode. Styling was built using pure CSS instead of frameworks to give it a bit more personal look.

App was built using React functional components with the best current practices to my knowledge.

<b>Some small betterments I made:</b>

- Added autofocus & required attributes to Input component
- Added aria-labels for accessibility
- Fixed a bug coming from using ordered ids
- Added dark mode
- Renamed components and variables to describe them more accurate
- Stored some CSS properties into variables for better maintenance

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

### `npm test`
